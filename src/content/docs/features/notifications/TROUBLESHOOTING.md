# System Notifications - Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Method not allowed" (405 Error)

**Symptom**: Getting 405 error when accessing the endpoint.

**Cause**: The endpoint only accepts POST requests, not GET.

**Solution**: 
- Use POST method when testing
- For browser testing, use a tool like Postman or curl
- Example curl command:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://sjrslms.jeevs.workers.dev/api/notifications/events/ingest \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "x-notification-ingest-token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"source":"release:pipeline","title":"Test","message":"Test","category":"deployment","release":{"version":"1.0.0","environment":"production","status":"success"}}'
  ```

### Issue 2: "Ingest token is not configured" (501 Error)

**Symptom**: Getting 501 error with message "Ingest token is not configured for source..."

**Possible Causes**:
1. Secrets not set in Cloudflare Workers
2. Secrets set but worker not redeployed
3. Secret propagation delay (can take a few minutes)
4. Wrong environment (secrets set for wrong environment)

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify secrets are set**:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret list --env=""
   ```
   Should show:
   - `NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN`
   - `NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN_RELEASE` (optional)
   - `NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN_SENTRY` (optional)
   - `NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN_CLOUDFLARE` (optional)

2. **Redeploy worker** (if secrets were just set):
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy --env=""
   ```

3. **Wait a few minutes** - Cloudflare secrets can take 1-2 minutes to propagate

4. **Check environment** - Make sure secrets are set for the correct environment:
   ```bash
   # For production (default)
   wrangler secret put NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN --env=""
   
   # For specific environment
   wrangler secret put NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN --env=production
   ```

5. **Verify token value** - Make sure the token in the request header matches the secret:
   ```bash
   # You can't read the secret value, but you can verify it's set
   wrangler secret list --env=""
   ```

---

### Issue 3: "Unauthorized ingest request" (401 Error)

**Symptom**: Getting 401 error with message "Unauthorized ingest request".

**Cause**: The token in the request header doesn't match any of the configured tokens.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check token header**:
   - Header name must be: `x-notification-ingest-token`
   - Token value must match one of:
     - `NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN` (global token)
     - Source-specific token (e.g., `NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN_RELEASE` for `release:pipeline`)

2. **Verify token format**:
   - No extra spaces or newlines
   - Exact match (case-sensitive)
   - No quotes around the token

3. **Test with global token first**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://sjrslms.jeevs.workers.dev/api/notifications/events/ingest \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-notification-ingest-token: YOUR_GLOBAL_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"source":"release:pipeline",...}'
   ```

### Issue 4: Empty Response Body

**Symptom**: Getting error status code but response body is empty.

**Possible Causes**:
1. CORS issue
2. Response serialization error
3. Network issue

**Solutions**:

1. **Check CORS headers** - The endpoint should return CORS headers
2. **Check network tab** - Look at the full response in browser dev tools
3. **Try different client** - Use curl or Postman instead of browser

---

### Issue 5: Deployment Notifications Not Appearing

**Symptom**: Running `npm run release` but no notification appears in System Notifications.

**Possible Causes**:
1. Token not configured in deployment script
2. Deployment script not calling ingest endpoint
3. Ingest endpoint failing silently

**Solutions**:

1. **Check deployment script** (`scripts/auto-version.js`):
   - Should have `NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN` or `NOTIFICATION_INGEST_TOKEN_RELEASE` set
   - Should call the ingest endpoint after deployment

2. **Check deployment logs**:
   - Look for: `📣 Posted deployment update to system notifications feed.`
   - Or: `ℹ️ Notification ingest token is not configured`

3. **Test manually**:
   ```bash
   # Test the ingest endpoint directly
   curl -X POST https://sjrslms.jeevs.workers.dev/api/notifications/events/ingest \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-notification-ingest-token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"source":"release:pipeline","title":"Test Deployment","message":"Testing","category":"deployment","release":{"version":"1.0.0","environment":"production","status":"success"}}'
   ```

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Verify Endpoint is Accessible

```bash
# Test with OPTIONS (should return 204)
curl -X OPTIONS https://sjrslms.jeevs.workers.dev/api/notifications/events/ingest

# Test with GET (should return 405)
curl -X GET https://sjrslms.jeevs.workers.dev/api/notifications/events/ingest
```

### Step 2: Verify Tokens are Set

```bash
wrangler secret list --env="" | Select-String -Pattern "NOTIFICATION"
```

Should show all notification tokens.

### Step 3: Test with Minimal Payload

```bash
curl -X POST https://sjrslms.jeevs.workers.dev/api/notifications/events/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-notification-ingest-token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "source": "release:pipeline",
    "title": "Test",
    "message": "Test",
    "category": "deployment",
    "release": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "environment": "production",
      "status": "success"
    }
  }'
```

### Step 4: Check System Notifications

1. Go to `/dashboard-superuser/system-notifications`
2. Look for the notification
3. Check filters (source, category, etc.)

## Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check logs**: Look at Cloudflare Workers logs for errors
2. **Verify configuration**: See `configuration-status.md`
3. **Test manually**: Use curl to test the endpoint directly
4. **Check permissions**: Make sure you have `notification_events:read` permission
